        These should be details of the person who will manage school experience requests for your school.
        These are needed to receive request notifications, reminders and information about updates to the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose a generic email address if possible, so that more than one person can access the emails if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contact details you provide will not be shared publicly or with candidates until youâ€™ve confirmed their school experience booking.
