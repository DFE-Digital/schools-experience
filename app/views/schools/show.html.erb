        Use this service if you're a school in England and want to offer

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>advertise experience at your school</li>
          <li>allow candidates to request experience dates</li>
          <li>accept or reject candidates requests for experience</li>
          <li>add other members from your school</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        You need a <strong>DfE Sign-in account</strong> with access to School Experience.

      <p>
        The service will ask you to outline the kind of experience you
        offer including details about DBS-checks and any fees you charge candidates.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's your responsibility to decide if candidates comply with your
        school DBS and safeguarding policies.
