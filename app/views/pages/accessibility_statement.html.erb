      </p>

      <p>
        We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For
        example, that means you should be able to:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the service using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the service using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>
          listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most
          recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We've also made the service text as simple as possible to understand.
