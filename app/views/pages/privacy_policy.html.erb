        Who we are
      </h2>
      <p>
        This work is being carried out by the Department for Education (DfE).
        For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data
        controller for the personal data processed as part of The Get Into
        Teaching Information Service, including the Get School
        Experience service.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How we will use your information
      </h2>
      <p>
        We receive and process the personal data you provided when completing
        either the Get Into Teaching registration form or the Get School
        Experience service registration form, because you have requested that
        we provide you with tailored advice and information about teacher
        training and a career as a teacher, or have requested school
        experience. These services will help you to make an informed decision
        about making an application.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Specifically we will use your data in the following ways:
      </h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          The information you provide in the registration forms (and any
          subsequent updates made via our helpline, including registration to
          events) is shared with our Get Into Teaching telephone helpline and
          web chat service to ensure that they have an accurate picture of your
          circumstances in order to provide a tailored service and information
          to you. Any subsequent information you provide to the helpline will
          also be recorded in order to continue to provide you with a tailored
          service.
        </li>

        <li>
          We use your contact details to communicate with you by telephone and
          to send you email, SMS and postal messages, providing you with
          information about a career in teaching. We may also contact you to
          gauge your interest in taking part in market research. In each
          message, you will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from
          further communications.
        </li>

        <li>
          The information we collect from you (such as your name, contact
          details and subject preferences) is used for identification,
          administration, analysis and targeting purposes. This allows us to
          ensure that public funds are being spent effectively.
        </li>

        <li>
          The information we collect from you may be used to deliver tailored
          messages on third party platforms, including social media - like
          Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Google search. Your
          information will also be used to identify and advertise to people
          that are similar to you, who may also be interested in our service.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you are using the Get School experience service, your data will be
          used to process your request for school experience with the school(s)
          in question. We will also use it to send out notifications, reminders
          and feedback questionnaires. We track your progress through this
          service to improve it for you and future applicants and to ensure
          public funds are being spent effectively.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your personal data, supplied for the purposes of this service, will be
        used as long as it is deemed necessary. We will delete this information
        if you request us to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do not supply us with your personal information then we cannot
        provide a tailored advice and information service or offer you access
        to the services available via our website such as booking a Train to
        Teach event. However, without registering, you can still access general
        information via the Get into Teaching helpline and website and can
        complete an application for Initial Teacher Training through UCAS
        Teacher Training.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        The nature of your personal data we will be using
      </h2>

      <p>
        The categories of your data, supplied by you through the registration forms and other interactions with us, that we will be using for this service are personal data such as:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Address</li>
        <li>Contact telephone number</li>
        <li>Date of birth</li>
        <li>IP Address</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We will also be collecting non-personal information such as:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Your teaching preferences</li>
        <li>Your intended training commencement year</li>
        <li>Your qualifications</li>
        <li>
          Any additional supplementary information you provide during
          communication with the helpline and/or personal advisers that will
          help us to aid you in progressing your application and continue to
          improve our service.

      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Why our use of your personal data is lawful
      </h2>

      <p>
        In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to
        meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. You
        have requested to receive this service and therefore, together with
        this privacy notice (about the use of your personal data), you have
        agreed to your data being used to deliver the service. However, the
        condition that we are relying on (once you have agreed to receiving the
        service) is that under Article 6 (1)(e) of the General Data Protection
        Regulations (GDPR) DfE is processing your personal data in the
        performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Who we will make your personal data available to
      </h2>

      <p>
        We share your information with trusted partners working to deliver the
        service under a legal contract on our behalf in order for us to
        continue to provide you with relevant information about a career in
        teaching and teacher training or 'the service'. These partners are
        required to strictly comply with our privacy policies that prohibit
        them using your personal data for any other purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        We share certain personal data with UCAS Teacher Training, who manage
        the application system for teacher training. Sharing personal
        information with UCAS Teacher Training enables us to identify those who
        have applied for teacher training, thus enabling us to remove the names
        of these applicants from our mailing lists. We also share data to track
        your application in order to determine the effectiveness of our
        service, monitor overall levels of teacher training applicants and
        improve it for you and future applicants.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are using the Get School Experience service, we will share some
        of your personal data to the staff who manage school experience at the
        school where you've requested school experience at. This allows them to
        process your application and get back to you about your school
        experience.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How long we will keep your personal data
      </h2>

      <p>
        We will only keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the
        purpose(s) of this service, after which point it will be securely
        destroyed. Please note that under the Data Protection Act, and in
        compliance with the relevant conditions, we can lawfully keep personal
        data processed purely for research purposes indefinitely.
