      How we use your personal data when you sign up for our services
    </h2>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>The additional information you provide when you communicate with the helpline and/or teacher training advisers will help us to aid you in progressing your application and continue to improve our service.</li>
      <li>We may also contact you to gauge your interest in taking part in market research. In each message, you will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from further communications.</li>
      <li>The information we collect from you (such as your name, contact details and subject preferences) is used for identification, administration, analysis and targeting purposes. This allows us to ensure that public funds are being spent effectively.</li>
      <li>We will use anonymised data about you to deliver tailored messages on third party platforms, including social media - like Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Google search. Such anonymised data will also be used to identify and advertise to people that are similar to you, who may also be interested in our service.</li>
      <li>If you are using the Get School Experience service, your data will be used to process your request for school experience with the school(s) in question. We will also use it to send out notifications, reminders and feedback questionnaires. We track your progress through this service to improve it for you and future applicants and to ensure public funds are being spent effectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Your personal data, supplied for the purposes of this service, will be stored in our customer relationship management system for 5 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not supply us with your personal information then we cannot provide a tailored advice and information service or offer you access to the services available via our website such as booking a Train to Teach event.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, without signing up for a teacher training adviser, signing up for an event or signing up for updates, you can still access general information via the Get into Teaching helpline and website, and can complete an application for Initial Teacher Training through UCAS Teacher Training.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Why our use of your personal data is lawful
    </h2>

    <p>
      In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. You have requested to receive this service and therefore, together with this privacy notice (about the use of your personal data), you have agreed to your data being used to deliver the service. However, the condition that we are relying on (once you have agreed to receiving the service) is that under Article 6 (1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) DfE is processing your personal data in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Who we will make your personal data available to
    </h2>

    <p>
      We share your information with trusted partners working to deliver the service under a legal contract on our behalf in order for us to continue to provide you with relevant information about a career in teaching and teacher training or 'the service'. These partners are required to strictly comply with our privacy policies that prohibit them using your personal data for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      We share certain personal data with UCAS Teacher Training, who manage the application system for teacher training. Sharing personal information with UCAS Teacher Training enables us to identify those who have applied for teacher training, and remove the names of these applicants from our communication list.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also share data to track your application in order to determine the effectiveness of our service, monitor overall levels of teacher training applicants and improve it for you and future applicants.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are using the Get School Experience service, we will share some of your personal data to the staff who manage school experience at the school where you've requested school experience. This allows them to process your application and get back to you about your school experience.
