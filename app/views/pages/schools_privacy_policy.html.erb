        Who we are
      </h2>

      <p>
        This work is being carried out by the Department for Education (DfE).
      </p>

      <p>
        Mentions of "us" and "we" mean DfE and "you" means anyone using this service.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data
        controller for the personal data processed as part of this service.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How we'll use your information
      </h2>

      <p>
        To facilitate school experience we collect the following details and data
        about school staff who manage the service when the school they work for
        or at signs up to the service:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>name</li>
        <li>email address</li>
        <li>UK telephone number</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These details are then shared with a candidate once their school
        experience request has been confirmed by the relevant school.
      </p>

      <p>
        School staff can delete or update their contact details at any time in
        the service.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of the service we'll use the contact information you've provided
        to send out notifications, reminders, feedback questionnaires and updates
        relating to the service. We may also contact you to request your involvement
        in user research to help improve the service.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will also use collected data for security purposes to protect the
        service - for example, parts of the IP addresses of website visitors are
        collected to block continuous direct denial of service attacks from
        an IP address range.

        Why our use of your personal data is lawful
      </h2>

      <p>
        In order to lawfully use your personal data, we need to meet one (or more)
        conditions in the data protection legislation. For the purpose of this
        project, your consent forms the basis of this as stated under GDPR
        Article 6 (1)(a).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Who we'll make your personal data available to
      </h2>

      <p>
        These might include contracted partners (who we've employed to process
        your personal data on our behalf) and / or other organisations (with whom
        we need to share your personal data for specific purposes).
      </p>

      <p>
        Where we need to share your personal data with others, we ensure that
        this data sharing complies with data protection legislation.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        How long we'll keep your personal data
      </h2>

      <p>
        DfE will only keep your personal data for as long
        as we need it for the purposes of their work, after which point it will
        be securely destroyed. If this is longer than 5 years your data will be
        deleted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: under Data Protection legislation, and in compliance with the
        relevant data processing conditions, personal data can be kept for
        longer periods of time when processed purely for archiving purposes in
        the public task, statistical purposes and historical or scientific
        research.
