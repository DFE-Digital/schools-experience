            Tell us about your availability. For example, if you're:
          </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              available for any specific placement dates offered by schools
            </li>
            <li>
              only available or unavailable for placements on particular days, dates or for certain periods of time
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The school will use this information to offer you the best dates it has available and will contact you to arrange the exact date of your placement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on availability and time of year, schools may not always be able to offer you the exact dates you’re looking for.

            Provide a short explanation. For example:
          </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              I want to experience day-to-day life in a school
            </li>
            <li>
              I want to find out and see if teaching is the right thing for me
            </li>
            <li>
              I want to observe and support pupils with class activities
            </li>
            <li>
              I want to see how teachers teach my subject
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This will help the school see if it can offer you the kind of placement you’re looking for.
