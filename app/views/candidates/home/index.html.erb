    <p>
      Use this service if you want to request school experience in a primary
      or secondary school in England.
    </p>

    <p>
      School experience allows you to find out more about teaching by visiting
      schools.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll need to provide personal details which schools will use to decide
      whether they can offer you school experience. They may contact you for
      further information.
