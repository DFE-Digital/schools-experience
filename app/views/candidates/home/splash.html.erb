        After you’ve requested a school experience placement, schools will
        contact you to discuss your placement request.
      </p>

  		<p>
        Be aware, during term time it could typically take up to 2 weeks for them
        to get in touch.
      </p>

  		<p>
        The school will email or call you to discuss your request and placement
        date and use this contact to:
      </p>

  		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  			<li>
          discuss your suitability for a placement at their site
        </li>

  			<li>
          offer and arrange the best placement date they have available
        </li>

        <li>
          find out more about your placement requirements - including any

        </li>

  			<li>
          let you know about any background and security checks you might need to

  		</ul>

      <p>

        need to pay any fees direct to the individual schools.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			You’ll receive emails after you’ve requested a placement and to confirm
        when a school has booked you on a placement.
