Hello,

We’re getting in touch to let you know we’ve added new features to manage school experience service: https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools 

#New features

The new features mean you can now:
* accept and reject school experience requests - including automatic email confirmations for candidates
* cancel school experience bookings - including automatic email confirmations for candidates
* add, edit and disable school experience dates on your school profile


You’ll be asked to sign in using ‘DfE Sign-in’ and we’ve included guidance on how to do this. 

#Update your profile
Before accessing the new features, you’ll  be asked to answer a few questions in order to update your school profile. 

#Help and support
If you’ve got any feedback, questions or would like to take part in user testing email us with your URN at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.
