Hello,

We’re getting in touch to let you know we’re in the process of adding a new management tool to the service so you can: 

•update your school profile to fit into an improved layout 


•add and amend specific school experience dates 



We’re aiming to have both improvements in place soon and we’ll be in touch to let you know when they’re available.

#Updating your profile

We’ve tested the new layout to make sure it contains the right kind of information and helps improve the quality of the requests you receive.

To let you know what to expect, here’s a preview of what your new improved profile will look like:

#Adding school experience dates


Your new date picker tool will give you the option of showing a list of dates to candidates which they can select as part of their school experience request.


To update your profile and pick your dates you’ll be asked to sign in to the service using DfE’s single sign-in system - DfE Sign-in.


If you don’t know what this - don’t worry. We’ll be providing you with full instructions on how to use it and access the service.
