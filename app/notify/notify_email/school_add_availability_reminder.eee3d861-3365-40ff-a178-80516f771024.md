Hello,

Thank you for joining the Get school experience service.

We hope you’re finding the service useful to promote and manage the school experiences you offer.

Please make sure you complete the Experience dates section of your profile. You can choose to list specific dates or show a description of when you can host candidates (for examples, set days of the week or at certain times of the year).

^ Add your availability: https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools/availability_preference/edit

Get school experience has over 4,000 users each month and we want to continue to increase the number of schools offering experiences through the service.

If other schools in your trust or partnership would benefit from using the service, they can email school.experience@education.gov.uk for more information.

If you manage school experiences for more than one school, you can create profiles for additional schools in the same way that you created your initial school profile.

If you have any questions or would prefer to send your feedback by email, please don’t hesitate to get in touch,

With thanks and best wishes,

Get school experience service.
