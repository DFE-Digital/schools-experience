Hello,

We’ve added some great new functionality which will allow you to self serve when you need to change something on your profile or add new dates. You’ll be asked to log in using DfE Sign-in.

# I have DfE Sign In account.  What do I do now?
*Request school experience: Get permission to access ‘school experience’ from one of your school’s DfE Sign In ‘approvers’ (often the head teacher or deputy head). Please request that they ‘add the service’ to the email address you use for DfE Sign In. If you are an ‘approver’ yourself you will see that the service is available once you have added it to your account.

#I don’t have a DfE Sign In account. What do I do now?
*Request a DfE Sign In account from an ‘approver’ at your school (often the head teacher or deputy head) with access to ‘school experience’. You should request access for a personal mailbox. This email address is purely used to gain access to the service and will not have an influence on where your service emails will be sent.

#I can’t remember if I have a DfE sign In account. What do I do now?
*Follow the link below and type in your email address. Press ‘forgot my password’ if you have registered in the past you will receive a password reset link. If the system doesn’t recognise you then you should follow the instructions on ‘I don’t have a DfE Sign In Account’

#I don’t know who my school’s approver is. What do I do now?
*If you are unable to identify a DfE Sign In 'approver' at your school please email the team – organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk

Once you’ve done this, you’ll then be able to return at any time to make changes in line with your changing needs and requirements.
Access the service via the below link. When you have signed in select ‘school experience’ to be directed to this service.  Please ensure you are signed in with your account if you share a computer
