Good Morning, ((school/name))

^ Get School Experience Service will be reactivated from 10am on Monday 22 February.

Following research with schools at the end of last year, we are launching two new features on the Get School Experience Service:

* A “Virtual” checkbox to flag to applicants that an offer is virtual and not in-school
* An “Export to spreadsheet” button which allows administrators to export data from the system easily

You will be able to add virtual or in-school school experience days to the service, and accept or reject applications using the service, as normal. If you have already scheduled future dates, applicants will still be able to apply for these.

To review and administer your experiences, or close your profile to booking requests, please visit https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools.

If you have any questions, please contact organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.

Kind regards,
The Get School Experience Team
