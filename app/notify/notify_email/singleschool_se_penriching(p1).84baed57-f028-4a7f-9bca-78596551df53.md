Hello,

Just a little reminder that the deadline for setting up your school's profile on the improved 'School Experience Service is tomorrow (19th March).
 
#Next Steps

1. Set up your basic account by 19 March

You need to send us a few details so we can set up your new school experience account.

The information you provide - including a description of your school and the experience offered - will be used to fill out your opening basic school experience profile on the improved service.

To set up your account and send us your profile information all you have to do is fill in and send us the following online form:

https://goo.gl/forms/v77VdxueQoulwOI53

Please complete a separate form for each school you organise school experience for. 

Before the end of the ‘switchover’ period, we’ll be in touch again to ask you to add more details to your profile as part of the ongoing improvements to the service. 

At this point you’ll be provided with a login to the improved service and you’re new account dashboard where you’ll be able to update your details and profile at any time.

2. Save your SEP data by 31 March

By 31 March 2019 you’ll need to have copied and saved all the information you want to keep within your SEP Portal account and calendar.

This is because you’ll no longer be able login to the SEP Portal after this date while we carry out the work to replace your existing account and calendar with your new account dashboard.

You’ll be given access to your new dashboard before the end of the ‘switchover’ period when it will help you manage all your school experience requests, bookings and other details in one place.

If you have any questions about any of the above or copying and saving the information stored in your SEP Portal account and calendar email us at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk and we’ll be in touch as soon as we can.
