Hello,

We’ve tried to get in touch with your school over the passed few weeks to make you aware that DfE is improving the school experience programme (SEP) in late March/early April.

Through the improved service, you’ll receive detailed profiles for each individual to help you decide who comes and gains experience at your school.

To help you make quick and easy decisions, every profile will include the following details about each applicant:

•	whether they’ve been DBS checked
•	information about their qualifications
•	their contact details - including address, email and telephone number
•	what they're looking to get from their placement 
•	how far they’ve got towards becoming a teacher 

Schools from right across the country have told us what they want and need from the improved service.

Signing up now means you’ll be able to join them and play a part in building a service which works best for you.

All you have to do to sign up is confirm the following details and send them to organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk:

* your contact name and email address 
* your school(s) name and URN(s) 

^If this has been forwarded to you by a colleague - please make sure you send your confirmation to organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.
 
If you do not to want to sign up, please reply and simply let us know by saying you do not want to use the improved school experience programme service.

If you’ve got any questions let us know and we’ll get back in touch as soon as we can.
