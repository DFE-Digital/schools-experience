Hello,

We’ve added some great new functionality to ‘Manage School Experience’ which will allow you to self serve when you need to stop (disable) requests, update details on the school’s profile, or add new dates (which can now be fixed or flexible).  To access this functionality you’ll be required to use DfE Sign-in.

If you already have a DfE Sign In account we will have granted you access to the service (school experience).  If we couldn’t find an account under your name we will have sent you an invite to create one.  When you have an account you will be able to access the service via the link below.

If you encounter any issues with DfE Sign In please first check that you are not signed in as a colleague (as they may not have signed out of your shared computer).  If that doesn’t resolve your issue please contact the team for support on:
