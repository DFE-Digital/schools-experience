Hello,
The first release of the improved school experience has now been launched. The part of the service that candidates access can be viewed here: 

https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/

During this phase you will receive email requests for school experience from candidates. At this phase of the service there is no ‘sign in’ function so to accept or reject these requests, please contact the candidate directly.
This is a temporary arrangement – in the next phase you will be able to manage requests and the your school information (including availability) via a dashboard. We are aiming to have this functionality live by the end of May. 

Currently your school, ((schoolandurn)) is not searchable on the site as you have opted in but we are yet to receive some additional school info to populate your school profile page.

Please provide this information by clicking the link below and filling out a short survey which should only take a couple of minutes.  Once submitted your school will go live the following Wednesday.

Once submitted, if you require a change to your school profile, please email our team on organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk. Amendments to school data happens every Wednesday so please send your requests through by close of play every Tuesday.

Thank you for your continued support.
