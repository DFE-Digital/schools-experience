Thank you for your contribution so far to the Get School Experience service.

As you will be aware, the government has decided that all schools should close as Friday 20 March 2020 in response to the ongoing threat of the COVID-19 virus, except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers.

As such, we appreciate it will be difficult for school experience to take place during this time. Therefore, we intend to switch all schoolsâ€™ profiles on the service to inactive by close of business on Wednesday 25 March 2020. If you do not wish us to do this for your school(s), we are asking that you notify us before that date. 

We will also be including a message on the service start page on GOV.UK to notify candidates that Schools Experience is not available at this time.
   
If you do intend to offer any alternative arrangement please get in touch with us via organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk so we can make changes for your school(s). 

Please get in touch via the mailbox above if you have any questions, and we thank you for all you are doing during this unprecedented time.

Yours Sincerely,
