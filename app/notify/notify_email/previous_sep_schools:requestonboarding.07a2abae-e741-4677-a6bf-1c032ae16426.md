Dear School Experience Administrator,

I’m the Product Manager for the Get School Experience [https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools] Service.

I wanted to email you as you were a previous provider of school experience on the School Experience Platform (SEP).

As you may know, we’ve replaced this service with Get School Experience, which allows schools like you to:
* advertise your school and school experience dates
* receive requests from candidates for you to accept or decline.

The aim of this service is to:
* minimise the admin burden associated with planning and running school experience
* give you access to a larger pool of potential candidates - we have over 5,000 users on the site per month
* help candidates make an informed choice that teaching is right for them
* help you build a pipeline of potential future teachers for your school, or group of schools

If your school is still offering school experience to potential ITT candidates, I’d love to help onboard you on to the new, improved service. I have time set aside to walk you through the process and answer any questions you may have.

If you’d like to take advantage of this support, do get in touch by replying to this email. Alternatively, there are instructions at the bottom of this email.

Thanks, and looking forward to hearing from you.
Myles Jarvis
Product Manager, Get School Experience Service

# Activating your profile on Get School Experience

1. Go to the Get school experience schools homepage and select ‘Start now’: https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools

2. Login with your DfE Sign-in username and password.
If you have issues logging in, contact our
support team at: organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk 
Provide your URN or organisation name in the email.

3. If you’re new to Get school experience, you’ll see a page that says you do not yet have access to the service. Select ‘Request access to a school’.

4. On the ‘Request an organisation’ page, search for your school using the school’s name or URN. Then select your school. 

5. You’ll be taken to the ‘Confirm request’ page. Enter the reason why you need to be linked to the school and select ‘Confirm’. For example,
^ “I need to administer school experience for this school. Please give me access to the school and add the School Experience service to my DfE Sign-in account as well.”

6. The request will be sent to your school’s approver. If you’re the school approver, the request will be approved automatically. 

7. Once you’ve received confirmation that your request has been approved, you’ll need to request to add the School Experience service to your account. (The approver may have already done this for you, if you mentioned it in your original request.)

#Request access to the School Experience service

8. Sign in to DfE Sign-in Services: https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/approvals/select-organisation?action=add-service. 

9. On the ‘Request a service for which organisation?’ page, select your school from the list and select ‘Continue’.

10.	Select ‘School Experience’ from the list of services and select ‘Continue’.

11.	Tick the box that says ‘School Experience Administration’ and select ‘Continue’.

12.	Submit the request. This will go to your approver. If School Experience does not appear in the list of services, you have the service already linked with your account and you can move onto creating your school profile.

# Create your School Profile

Once your access to the school experience service has been approved, you’ll need to set up your school profile. This is what candidates will see when they search for school experience. 

1.	Log into Get school experience: https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools

2.	This will take you to your dashboard.

You’ll need to add details about your school experience such as:

* what education stages you offer experience for
* if you charge admin fees
* if candidates need a DBS certificate

Here are some examples of school profiles:
 * https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/candidates/schools/116412

* https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/candidates/schools/138611

# Add school experience dates

You’ll need to add dates for your experience.

1.	On the dashboard page, select ‘Manage dates’.
2.	Then select ‘Add a date’.
3.	Enter details for your school experience date and select ‘Continue’. You can add as many dates as you like. You can also add more another time.

Once you’ve set up your school profile and added dates, your school should now appear in the searches candidates are making.

# Managing requests from candidates

You can manage requests you receive through the ‘Manage requests’ link on your dashboard. You can also find them directly here: https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools/placement_requests.
