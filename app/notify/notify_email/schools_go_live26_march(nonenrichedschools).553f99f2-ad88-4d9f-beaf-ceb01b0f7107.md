Hello,

The improved school experience service is now live and you’ll soon start receiving your updated school experience requests.

To help you make quick and easy decisions, the requests you’ll receive through the ‘Manage school experience’ service will include the following details about each applicant:

*their contact details – including address, email and telephone number
*information about their qualifications
*how far they’ve got towards becoming a teacher
*what they’re looking to get from their placement
*whether they’ve been DBS checked

As part of the first group of schools to sign up, you’ll already know that we are rolling out the service across a ‘switchover’ period before it goes live to everyone else in June 2019.

During the ‘switchover’ period, you will receive the above details in an email. You will need to let the applicant know if you can offer them an experience, and you are welcome to contact them with any further questions or to discuss their requirement.

Candidates can now search for experiences at your school at https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk. If you need to make any changes to your profile during the ‘switchover’ (such as to your availability) you can email these to organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.

^We have not yet received any extra profile detail for your school / all of your schools (see below). To help promote your school, and to receive more appropriate requests, please complete this short form:  https://goo.gl/mdRaK6

#Adding extra functions

Schools have been telling us what they want and need from the improved service so we’ll be adding extra functions as the ‘switchover’ period progresses including:

*a new account dashboard – so you can manage your school experience requests and bookings in one place
*an improved school experience profile – to help you attract the kind of candidates you’re looking for
*an improved school experience search facility – to help candidates find the kind of experience they’re looking for
*the sending of auto-generated emails and reminders – to help save you time and keep candidates informed
*the ability to confirm candidate attendance – to help reduce candidate no-shows and repeated cancellations

Before the ‘switchover’ period ends, we’ll be in touch again to ask you for details so we can pass on these improvements to the service.

At this point you’ll be provided with a login for your new account dashboard where you’ll be able to update your details at any time.

#Save your SEP data

By 31 March 2019 you’ll need to have copied and saved all the information you want to keep within your SEP Portal account and calendar.

This is because you’ll no longer be able login to the SEP Portal after this date while we carry out the work to replace your existing account and calendar with your new account dashboard.

In the meantime, if you’ve got any feedback or questions about any of the above or would like to take part in user testing contact us at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk
