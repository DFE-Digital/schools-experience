Hello,

We’ve added some great new functionality which will allow you to self serve when you need to change something on your profile or add new dates.  

You’ll be asked to log in using DfE Sign-in (which recently replaced ‘Secure Access’) and allows you to access lots of DfE services via a single username (email address) and password.  After which you’ll be able to:

* Update your school profile page

* Add specific school experience dates using our date picker tool

#Using DfE Sign-in

*I have DfE Sign In account         

You are now required to get permission to access 'school experience' from one of your school's DfE Sign In 'approvers'  (often the head teacher or deputy head).  Please request that they 'add the service' to the email address you use for DfE Sign In.  If you are an 'approver' yourself you will see that the service is available once you have added it to your account.

*I don’t have a DfE Sign In account

Request a DfE Sign In account from an ‘approver’ at your school (often the head teacher or deputy head) with access to 'school experience'.  You should request access for a personal mailbox.  This email address is purely used to gain access to the service and will not have an influence on where your service emails will be sent.

*I can’t remember if I have a DfE sign In account

Follow the link above and type in your email address.  Press ‘forgot my password’ if you have registered in the past you will receive a password reset link.  If the system doesn’t recognise you then you should follow the instructions on ‘I don’t have a Dfe Sign In Account’

*I don't know who my school's approver is

If you are unable to identify a DfE sign in approver at your school please email the team – organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk

Once you’ve done this, you’ll then be able to return at any time to make changes in line with your changing needs and requirements.

Access the service via the below link:

Help and support

If you’ve got any feedback, questions or would like to take part in user testing contact us at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.

Other upcoming improvements

Finally, we’re in the process of introducing a new request and bookings dashboard view to help you manage your school experience all in one place within the service.

 We’re just in the final stages of testing the dashboard with schools and once this is complete we’re hoping to give you access to it before the end of June 2019.
