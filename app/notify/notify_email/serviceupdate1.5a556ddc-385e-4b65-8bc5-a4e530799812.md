Hello,

The first release of the improved school experience has now been launched.  The part of the service that candidates access can be viewed here: 

https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/

During this phase you will receive email requests for school experience from candidates.  At this phase of the service there is no ‘sign in’ function so to accept or reject these requests, please contact the candidate directly.

This is a temporary arrangement - in the next phase you will be able to manage requests and the your school information (including availability) via a dashboard.  We are aiming to have this functionality live by the end of May.  In the meantime, if you require a change to your school profile, please email our team on organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.  Amendments to school data happens every Wednesday so please send your requests through by close of play every Tuesday.
 
We have received lots of really helpful feedback from schools since we launched and already made some small improvements to the system, including:
•	Helping candidates to request the right dates (this will improve again in the next phase, with a specific date picker)
•	Restricting candidates to only select subjects which are offered in their school of choice

Please do get in touch with the team if you have any feedback or questions: organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk . 

Thank you for your continued support.
