Hello,
 
We’re rolling out the improved school experience programme (SEP) across a ‘switchover’ period which starts at the end of March and ends in June 2019. 

Schools and candidates from across the country have told us what they want us to include in the improved service and we’ve listened to the feedback.

This means from the start of this step-by-step roll-out and the end of March each of your schools will: 

* receive detailed profiles from candidates who want to spend time in your school so you decide who can attend and when 
* need to contact candidates directly with your decision 

Before the service goes live for everyone in June, extra functions will be added as the ‘switchover’ period progresses including:

* a new dashboard view - to help better manage school experience requests and bookings
* an improved school experience profile - to help attract the kind of candidates you’re looking for
* an improved school experience search facility - to help candidates find your schools and the kind of experience they’re looking for
* the sending of auto-generated emails and reminders - to help save your schools time and keep candidates informed
* the ability to confirm candidate attendance - to help reduce candidate no-shows and repeated cancellations

# Next steps

1. Set up school accounts by 19 March

You’ll need to send us a few details about each of your schools so we can set up their new school experience accounts.

The information you provide - including a description for each school and the experiences they offer - will be used to fill out their opening basic school experience profiles on the improved service.

To set up each school’s account and send us their profile information all you have to do is fill in and send us one of the following online forms for each school:

Before the end of the ‘switchover’ period, we’ll be in touch again to ask your schools to add more details to their profiles as part the ongoing improvements to the service.

At this point you’ll be able to manage your school experience through the new account dashboard where you’ll be able to update school details and profiles at any time.

2. Save your SEP data  by 31 March
By 31 March 2019 you’ll need to have copied and saved all the information you want to retain within your SEP Portal account and calendar.

This is because your schools will no longer be able login to the SEP Portal after this date while we carry out the work to replace your existing accounts and calendars with your new account dashboards.

You will be given access to your new dashboards before the end of the ‘switchover’ period when it will help you manage all your school experience requests, bookings and other details in one place.

If you have any questions about any of the above or copying and saving the information stored in your SEP Portal account and calendar email us at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk and we’ll be in touch as soon as we can.
