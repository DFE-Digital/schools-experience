Hello,

We’re getting in touch to let you know we’ve added new features to manage school experience service: https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools

#New features
The new features mean you can now:

* accept and reject school experience requests – including automatic email confirmations for candidates
* cancel school experience bookings – including automatic email confirmations for candidates
* add, edit and disable school experience dates on your school profile

^The service will only list requests and bookings made on or after 3 September 2019 so you’ll need to refer to your own records for any requests received or bookings made before this date.

#Help and support
If you’ve got any feedback, questions or would like to take part in user testing email us with your URN at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.
