Dear School Experience Administrator,
 
We’ve noticed that you have at least one school set up on Manage School Experience, but it is currently not enabled. This means that potential candidates cannot request school experience with your school at this time. It also means your school will not be appearing in searches on the service.
 
As the Product Manager of the service, I’d love to know if there’s anything that’s stopping you reactivating your school(s), and whether me and my team can do anything to help remove these barriers.
 
I’ve also attached some instructions to help you re-activate your profile on Manage School Experience. You can start the process by going to this link:

Looking forward to hearing from you, and do let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.

# Reactivating your profile on Manage School Experience

1. Navigate to the Manage School Experience homepage
(https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools) and click Start now.

2. Login with your DfE Sign In username and password.
If you have issues logging in here, please contact our
support team on: organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk. Please provide your URN/organisation name in the email.

3. Select the school you want to manage first. Click the relevant circle shaped button and click Continue/Select School.

4. You will now be at your school dashboard. You will need to do a couple of tasks to ensure your school is ready to receive requests:

^ * Add dates for your School Experience programme (scroll to the ‘Manage Dates’ section of the dashboard, and click on the options there to populate when you are able to host School Experience this school year). You do not have to do all dates for the year at once, you can keep coming back and adding as you go.
^ * Review your school profile to ensure it is up
to date (Scroll down to the Account Admin section of your dashboard and click update school profile. Ensure you amend details and then click continue at the bottom of the ‘check answers’ page to save your amendments. (https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools/on_boarding/profile)
^ * Enable your school on the service (scroll down to the Account Admin section of the dashboard and click Turn requests on/off (https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools/toggle_enabled/edit)

Your school should now be appearing in searches that potential school experience candidates are making. You can then manage these requests from your dashboard. You may have previous requests in the system - we are working to develop a way to clear these. Alternatively, you can reject these requests. You can do so here: https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools/placement_requests
