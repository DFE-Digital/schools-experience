Good Morning ((change as applicable))

We are writing to remind you that at 10am on Monday 22 February, your school will be reactivated on the improved Get School Experience Service.

From this date, you will be able to add (virtual or in-school) school experience days to the service, and accept or reject applications using the service, as normal. If you have already scheduled future dates, applicants will still be able to apply for these.  To review and administer your experiences, or close your profile to booking requests, please visit https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools.

If you have any questions, please contact organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.

Kind regards,

The Get School Experience Team
