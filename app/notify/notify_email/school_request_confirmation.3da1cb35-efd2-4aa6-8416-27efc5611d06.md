# Accept or reject their request

The candidate is aware you may be in touch to discuss their school experience request.

It's your responsibility to book them on experience at your school and you can email or call them to:

* discuss their request and suitability for school experience at your site
* offer and arrange the best available school experience dates
* find out more about their requirements - including any disability or access needs
* explain any background and security checks they might need to go through
* explain any fees they might need to pay - including any administration, DBS check, parking or other fees

Once you’ve made your decision you’ll need to confirm this with the candidate via email or telephone.

# Service development and updates

* a new dashboard - so you can quickly access and view candidate requests and bookings
* an improved school profile - to attract the kind of candidates you’re looking for
* an improved search facility - to help candidates find your school and the kind of experience they’re looking for
* auto-generated emails and reminders - to save you time and keep candidates informed
* the ability to confirm candidate attendance - to reduce candidate no-shows and repeated cancellations
