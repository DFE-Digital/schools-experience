Hello,

Here’s a few things about the service which we thought it would be useful for you to know ahead of the summer break.

#Turning off requests
On Friday 19 July we’ll be turning off new school experience requests coming to you over the summer break.

To keep receiving requests between then and September, you’ll need to complete your school experience profile. Do this by signing in to the service using the following link and selecting ‘Update school profile’:
https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools

If you have any problems signing in, email us with your URN at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.

We suggest you only keep receiving requests if someone is available over the summer to respond to candidates. 


#New management tools
We’re continuing to add features and enhancements throughout the summer. Let us know if you’d like to find out how the new management tools can help you with your school experience requests by emailing us with your URN at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.
 
#Thank you
Finally, we’d just like to thank you for your time and patience over the past few months since the launch of the service.  

Your help and support has been invaluable in improving the service and we look forward to working with you over the remainder of 2019 as we roll-out the service across the rest of England.

If you’ve got any feedback or questions about the service email us with your URN at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.
