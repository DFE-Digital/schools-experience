Hello,

Here’s a few things about the service which we thought it would be useful for you to know ahead of the summer break.

#Turning requests off
If no one is available at your school over the summer to accept or reject requests we suggest you login to the service and turn your requests off. 
 
Do this by selecting the ‘Turn requests on / off’ link on your account: https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools 

When you return for the new school year, use the same link to turn your requests on so you can start receiving fresh requests from candidates.

#New management tools
We’re continuing to add features and enhancements throughout the summer.  Let us know if you’d like to find out how the new management tool can help you with your school experience requests by emailing us with your URN at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.

#Thank you
Finally, we’d just like to thank you for your time and patience over the past few months since the launch of the service.  

Your help and support has been invaluable in improving the service and we look forward to working with you over the remainder of 2019 as we roll-out the service across the rest of England.

#Help and support
If you’ve got any feedback or questions about the service email us with your URN at organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk.
