Dear Colleague,

Thank you for signing up to use the Manage Schools Experience Service. It is great to see you are advertising School Experience dates as we have lots of potential future teachers looks for an opportunity to get a taster of the classroom setting before they go on to apply to ITT.

However, our data is showing us that some candidates who have requested your advertised dates, are still awaiting your response or waited over the agreed 10 days.

We have created the service to provide the best possible experience for all our users including potential teachers and schools. 

The service has been designed to enable schools to easily accept or reject requests whilst using the templates as well as keeping a record of everything in one place. The hope is, that in future, this will allow the service to automate the sending of reminder emails to candidate you have accepted alongside other features.

We would be grateful if you could respond to the candidate by either accepting or rejecting their request or close/cancel the request if no longer available. 

If you have any issues or are unsure how to respond to a candidate request please get in touch Organise.School-Experience@education.gov.uk and we will be in touch. 

In the meantime, if you have any feedback on the service please do get in touch.

Thanks,

Manage school experience service team
