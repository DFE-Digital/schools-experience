Feature: Other Fee
  So candidates know where their money is going
  As a school administrator
  I want to provide details of the Other fees we charge

  Background: I have completed the previous steps
    Given I am logged in as a DfE user
    And the secondary school phase is availble
    And the college phase is availble
    And I have completed the following steps:
        | Step name                        | Extra                     |
        | DBS Requirements                 |                           |
        | Candidate Requirements choice    |                           |
        | Candidate Requirements selection |                           |
        | Fees                             | choosing only Other costs |

  Scenario: Page title
    Given I am on the 'other costs' page
    Then the page title should be 'Other costs'

  Scenario: Completing the Other costs step with error
    Given I have entered the following details into the form:
      | Explain what the fee covers. | Falconry lessons |
      | Explain how the fee is paid  | Gold sovereigns  |
    And I choose 'Daily' from the 'Is this a daily or one-off fee?' radio buttons
    When I submit the form
    Then I should see a validation error message

  Scenario: Completing the Other costs step with error
    Given I have entered the following details into the form:
      | Enter the number of pounds   | 300              |
      | Explain what the fee covers. | Falconry lessons |
      | Explain how the fee is paid  | Gold sovereigns  |
    And I choose 'Daily' from the 'Is this a daily or one-off fee?' radio buttons
    When I submit the form
    Then I should be on the 'Phases' page
