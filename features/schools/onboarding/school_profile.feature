Feature: School Profile
  So I can ensure the data I've entered is accurate
  As a school administrator
  I want to be able to view my school profile

  Background: I have completed the wizard thus far
    Given I am logged in as a DfE user
    And A school is returned from DFE sign in
    And the secondary school phase is availble
    And the college phase is availble
    And there are some subjects available
    And I have completed the following steps:
        | Step name                        | Extra                     |

  Scenario: Page title
    Given I am on the 'Profile' page
    Then the page title should be 'Check your answers before setting up your school experience profile'

  Scenario: Breadcrumbs
    Given I am on the 'Profile' page
    Then I should not see any breadcrumbs

  Scenario: Breadcrumbs when school is onboarded
    Given the school is fully-onboarded
    And I am on the 'Profile' page
    Then I should see the following breadcrumbs:
        | Text           | Link               |
        | Some school    | /schools/dashboard |
        | School profile | None               |
