Feature: School Profile
  So I can ensure the data I've entered is accurate
  As a school administrator
  I want to be able to view my school profile

  Background: I have completed the wizard thus far
    Given I am logged in as a DfE user
    And A school is returned from DFE sign in
    And the secondary school phase is availble
    And the college phase is availble
    And there are some subjects available
    And I have completed the following steps:
