Feature: Access needs policy
  So candidates know what to expect
  As a school administrator
  I want to be able to link to our access needs policy

  Background: I have completed the wizard thus far
    Given I am logged in as a DfE user
    And the secondary school phase is availble
    And the college phase is availble
    And there are some subjects available
    And I have completed the following steps:

        | Fees                             | choosing only Other costs |
        | Other costs                      |                           |
        | Phases                           |                           |
        | Subjects                         |                           |
