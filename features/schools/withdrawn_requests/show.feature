Feature: Viewing a withdrawn request
    To help me review a withdrawn placement request
    As a school administrator
    I want to be able to view all submitted information

    Background:
        Given I am logged in as a DfE user
        And my school is fully-onboarded
        And my school has fixed dates
        And the school has subjects

        When I am viewing the withdrawn request
        Then the page title should start with 'Withdrawn request'

    Scenario: Breadcrumbs
        Given there is at least one withdrawn request
        When I am viewing the withdrawn request
        Then I should see the following breadcrumbs:
