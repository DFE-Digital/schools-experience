Feature: Viewing a cancelled booking
    To help me review past school experience bookings
    As a school administrator
    I want to be able to view all submitted information

    Background:
        Given I am logged in as a DfE user
        And my school is fully-onboarded
        And the school has subjects

    Scenario: Page title
        Given there is at least one cancelled booking
        When I am viewing my chosen cancelled booking
        Then the page title should start with 'Booking details'
        And the page title should include the booking reference

    Scenario: Breadcrumbs
        Given there is at least one cancelled booking
        When I am viewing my chosen cancelled booking
        Then I should see the following breadcrumbs:
            | Text              | Link                        |
            | Some school       | /schools/dashboard          |
            | Cancelled bookings | /schools/cancelled_bookings  |
            | Booking           | None                        |
