Feature: Viewing a previous booking
    To help me review past school experience bookings
    As a school administrator
    I want to be able to view all submitted information

        Given I am logged in as a DfE user
        And my school is fully-onboarded

    Scenario: Page title
        Given there is at least one previous booking
        When I am viewing my chosen previous booking
