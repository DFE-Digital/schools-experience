Feature: Viewing a booking
    To help me make decisions about school experience requests
    As a school administrator
    I want to be able to view all submitted information

    Background:
        Given I am logged in as a DfE user
        And my school is fully-onboarded
        And the school has subjects
        And the scheduled booking date is in the future

    Scenario: Page title
        Given there is at least one booking
        When I am viewing my chosen booking
        Then the page title should start with 'Booking details'
        And the page title should include the booking reference

    Scenario: Breadcrumbs
        Given there is at least one booking
        When I am viewing my chosen booking
        Then I should see the following breadcrumbs:
            | Text           | Link               |
            | Some school    | /schools/dashboard |
            | Bookings       | /schools/bookings  |
            | Booking        | None               |
