# School Experience Documentation

## Overview

### THE STRATEGY

#### What is our Strategic Priority?

To ensure there are high quality teachers in our schools for the long term


#### What is our target?

To get 30,000 new trainee teachers every year


#### What is School Experience?

When a potential teacher spends some time in a school, observing and experiencing teaching / school life


#### How will the School Experience Service help? 

The School Experience Service will help:

1. more potential teachers easily find an appropriate school experience
near them so that they can make an informed choice about a career in
teaching
1. schools and other providers recruit more of the trainee teachers they
need, and manage the demand for school experience from candidates
1. government access timely data that will inform teacher recruitment
policy and continuously improve the service

This will contribute to the overall vision that teachers can access a
seamless set of services to begin their career. 


#### What is the outcome?

It helps potential teachers decide or verify whether a school career is for them

It helps avoid drop outs of the Initial Teacher Training programme. 


#### How does School Experience fit in with the wider Get into Teaching Programme?


## Accessibility

The School Experience service has been designed and developed with all users in mind. We have designed in line with the GDS Design Guidelines and Patterns.
We have also designed and developed the service to support a wide range of [browsers and devices](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices)

The service has been tested with a number of schools and candidates with different equipment and browsers. 

The service was also audited by the national Disability Assessment Centre in Swansea. The DAC only found a small number of minor issues which we are currently working on to fix. 

A copy of the report is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wEXgQDF-AsZLp8RFcoPWekSpin4VrNBb/view).
