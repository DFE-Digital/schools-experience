        availability:
          - Tell us about your availability. For example, when you'll be
            available for placements or any particular days or periods when you
            won't.
          - The school will contact you to arrange the exact date of your
            placement and will use this information to offer you the best dates
            it has available.
          - Depending on availability and time of year, schools may not always
            be able to offer you the exact dates you’re looking for.
        objectives:
          - Provide a short explanation about what you want to gain from your placement.
          - This will help the school see if it can offer you the kind of placement you’re looking for.
