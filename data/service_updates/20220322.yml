title: 22 March 2022 – Publish multiple experience dates
summary: |-
  We've created a new feature that allows you to publish multiple school experience dates.
html_content: |-

  <p>When you add a school experience date, you’ll be asked whether this is a recurring date.
  For example, you might want to publish a school experience date that occurs at a regular interval, for example every fortnight to coincide with your teaching timetable.
  You can schedule as many dates as you would like, up to 4 months in advance.</p>

  <h3>Scheduled experience dates</h3>
  <p>When you decide to publish an experience date available to candidates in the future, this will now show a ‘scheduled’ status, instead of ‘closed’.</p>

  <h3>Improved profile editing</h3>
  <p>The ‘update profile’ page is now split into 3 tabbed sections – school experience details, candidate information and contact information. This will make it easier to find the information that you wish to edit on your school profile.</p>
