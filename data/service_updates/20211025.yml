title: 25 October 2021 - 'under consideration' status tag and new features
summary: You can now place a request ‘under consideration’ before you accept it or decline it.
html_content: |-
  <p>
    We’ve created a new status tag for requests that are under consideration. 
  </p>
  <p>
  This allows you to contact a candidate for more information before you make a decision about their request.
  </p>
  <p>
  When you open up a request you’ll now have 3 actions to choose from: 

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>‘Accept request’</li>
  <li>‘Decline request’</li>
  <li>‘Place under consideration’</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  If you place a request ‘under consideration’, you’ll see this new tag next to it in ‘Manage requests’.
  </p>

  <h3>Exporting requests and bookings by date range</h3>

  <p>You can now select a date range when exporting CSV files of requests.</p>

  <p><strong>Auto-declining requests from users that do not have a DBS check</strong></p>

  <p>If a candidate without a DBS certificate requests experience at a school that requires a DBS, the system will automatically decline their request.
  </p>

  <h3>Flagging duplicate requests</h3>

  <p>If a candidate who has already requested experience at your school tries to make another request, the system will recognise this as a duplicate request. 

  You’ll see the ‘flagged’ status tag next to these requests on the ‘Manage requests’ page. This will help you to decline requests from candidates you’ve already turned down.
  </p>
