title: 25 January 2022 - Choosing when to close dates to candidates and other features
summary: We've created a new feature that allows you to choose when to close a school experience date.
html_content: |-
  <p>
    When you add a date, you'll now be able to choose when to close that date to candidates. For example, you might want to close a date 2 days before the event, to give you time to prepare for it.

  <h3>More reasons to choose from when declining a request</h3>

  <p>
  We’ve added more reasons to choose from when you turn down a request. This should make it quicker and easier to decline requests.
  </p>

  <p>
  Reasons you can choose from now include:

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>‘You asked us to cancel your request’</li>
  <li>‘You’ve told us you want to get primary school experience, but you’ve chosen a secondary school placement’</li>
  <li>‘You’ve told us you want to get secondary school experience, but you’ve chosen a primary school placement’</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>SMS notifications</h3>

  <p>
  To help improve school experience attendance rates, we’ve set up SMS notifications for candidates.
  </p>

  <p>
  Candidates will now receive an SMS message:

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>when their booking has been confirmed</li>
  <li>one week before their school experience</li>
  <li>one day before their school experience</li>
  <li>if their booking has been cancelled</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Archiving expired requests</h3>

  <p>
  We now archive expired requests after 30 days. If you need to view your archived requests, you can follow the link to them on the Manage requests page.
  </p>
